# SigMAL

Sig Mal based projects! Woo!

Plans:
Python

-Read port and IP from argv. Some kind of net to ensure that even if you write garbage input program makes sure you write good input.
Input format:

* T/U - TCP or UDP
* ip
* port(ask  if they want 0-1023, or the whole nine yards.)

- Document it!

A MUST:
hacker interface. NEEEEED IT (kill me)



Optional:

*Concurrency. 

*Find out what the service is, depending on port. (will require some googling)
